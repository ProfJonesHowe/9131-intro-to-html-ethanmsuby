    <h1>This Is Why Science-Based Lifting Is Beneficial</h1>
    <h2>What Is Science-Based Lifting?</h2>
    <p>
        Science-based lifting is an approach to strength training that uses evidence from exercise science and physiology
        to optimize performance, recovery, and muscle growth. It involves structured programming, progressive overload,
        and proper technique backed by research.

    <h2>Fun Facts About Lifting</h2>
    <p>
        Did you know that compound lifts like squats and deadlifts engage multiple muscle groups and can boost testosterone levels?
        Or that your muscles grow not during the workout, but while you rest and recover afterward?

        One of my favorite hobbies is going to the gym. I enjoy tracking my progress, hitting new personal records,
        and learning how small tweaks in form or routine can make a big difference. It’s not just about getting stronger—
        it’s about improving overall health and discipline.
